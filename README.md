# ✨ Inspire Me - Advanced Random Quote Generator

A modern, interactive web application that provides daily inspiration through a collection of over 400+ quotes from the world's greatest minds. This project was built to practice front-end development, API handling (JSON), and browser-based storage.

## Features

I have implemented several advanced features to make the user experience more engaging:

* **🎲 Random Quote Logic:** Generates a new piece of wisdom with a single click.
* **🌓 Dark Mode / Light Mode:** A fully integrated theme switcher that remembers your preference.
* **🔊 Text-to-Speech:** Uses the Browser Speech API to read quotes aloud for accessibility.
* **❤️ Favorite Quotes:** Save your favorite quotes to a "Favorites" list that persists even after you refresh the page (using `localStorage`).
* **🎨 Dynamic Backgrounds:** The background color changes smoothly with every new quote in Light Mode.
* **📋 Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy the quote and author to share anywhere.
* **🐦 Social Sharing:** Direct integration to share your favorite quotes instantly on Twitter.

##  Built With

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Modern layouts with Flexbox, CSS Variables, and smooth transitions.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Logic for fetching data, DOM manipulation, and browser APIs.
* **JSON:** A local database of over 400 inspirational quotes.

## How to Run Locally

Since this project uses the `fetch()` API to load the `quotes.json` file, it is best viewed through a local server.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/inspire-me.git](https://github.com/your-username/inspire-me.git)
    ```
2.  **Open with Live Server:**
    * If you use **VS Code**, install the "Live Server" extension.
    * Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
3.  **Manual Way:**
    * Simply open the folder and drag `index.html` into your browser (Note: Some browsers may block JSON loading for security; use a local server for the best experience).
